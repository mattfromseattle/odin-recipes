      <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
     Korma is a rich and aromatic Indian curry dish made with meat (commonly chicken, lamb, or beef) that is slow-cooked in a blend of spices, yogurt, and sometimes nuts. The dish is known for its creamy texture and complex flavors, often enhanced with ingredients like garlic, ginger, and various spices such as cumin, coriander, and cardamom. Korma can be served with rice or naan bread and is a popular choice in Indian cuisine for its indulgent taste and comforting qualities.
     Korma has its roots in Mughlai cuisine, which was influenced by Persian cooking traditions. The dish is often associated with royal feasts and celebrations, making it a special occasion meal. There are many regional variations of korma across India and Pakistan, each with its own unique twist on the traditional recipe, including vegetarian versions that use paneer or vegetables instead of meat.
     Korma is not only a flavorful dish but also a symbol of the rich culinary heritage of the Indian subcontinent, showcasing the art of slow cooking and the use of aromatic spices to create a dish that is both satisfying and memorable.

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, marinate the chicken pieces with yogurt, garlic, ginger, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the refrigerator for better flavor).</li>
        <li>Heat the oil or ghee in a large pot over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until the chicken is browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the coriander powder, garam masala, and ground almonds/cashews (if using). Mix well to coat the chicken with the spices.</li>
        <li>Add water to the pot, cover, and let it simmer on low heat for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>If using heavy cream, stir it in during the last 5 minutes of cooking for a richer sauce.</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning with salt and additional spices as needed. If you like it spicier, add slit green chilies at this stage.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with naan bread or steamed rice.</li>
    </ol>
