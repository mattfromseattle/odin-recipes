      <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
     Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish made from fermented vegetables, primarily napa cabbage and Korean radishes, seasoned with chili pepper, garlic, ginger, and other spices. It is known for its spicy and tangy flavor and is a staple in Korean cuisine.
     Kimchi is not only a flavorful accompaniment but also packed with probiotics, making it beneficial for gut health. It can be enjoyed on its own, as a side dish, or incorporated into various dishes like fried rice, stews, and pancakes.
     The fermentation process gives kimchi its unique taste and extends its shelf life, allowing it to be stored for months. There are countless variations of kimchi, each with its own regional and seasonal ingredients, making it a versatile and beloved dish in Korean culture.
